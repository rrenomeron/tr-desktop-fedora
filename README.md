# Experimental ``silverblue-tr`` Build  

This is an experiment to build my personal Fedora Silverblue ``bootc`` image without using BlueBuild.
The reasons to do this are primarily to leverage some neat things from Bluefin/Universal Blue build patterns such as

- Automatically rebuild when the base image updates via RenovateBot
- Building Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Enabling a testing stream

## About ``silverblue-tr``

This image is [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/)) with customizations from Bluefin and Universal Blue and
own personal preferences baked in to the image.  It's goals are to make provisioning new devices simpler, and to
keep a consistent baseline of applications between them.

These are the important features of this image:

- Google Chrome RPM installed and set as default browser
- Clocks set to AM/PM view with Weekday Display
- Curated selection of Flatpak apps installed automatically
- Single click to open items in Nautilus
- Nautilus icons [match accent
  color](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7535/accent-directories/)
- [System monitor applet](https://github.com/mgalgs/gnome-shell-system-monitor-next-applet) in
  top panel next to Gnome system menu
- [DeskChanger](https://github.com/BigE/desk-changer/) wallpaper manager
- [Weather applet](https://gitlab.gnome.org/somepaulo/weather-or-not)
- Use smaller icons in Nautilus icon view
- Sort directories first in Nautilus and GTK file choosers
- Dark styles enabled by default
- [System76 wallpaper collection](https://system76.com/merch/desktop-wallpapers)
- [Framework 12](https://frame.work/laptop12) wallpapers
- [Intel One Mono](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html) set as
  default monospace font
- Visual Studio Code RPM installed
- Libvirt virtualization stack installed
- Docker CE installed with rootful Docker disabled
- Dash-to-Dock enabled by default, skipping Overview on login
- Appindicators enabled by default
- Logo Menu enabled by default, like Bluefin
- Windows have minimize and maximize buttons (like Ubuntu and Bluefin)
- Additional packages (e.g. Firewall GUI, rclone/restic, Universal Blue enhancements)
- ``ujust`` scripts from Universal Blue images
- ``<CTRL><ALT>t`` opens a terminal

  - Container signing and SBOM Generation
  - See checklist below to enable these as they take some manual configuration

### Homebrew Integration

- Includes curated collections: development tools, fonts, CLI utilities. Go nuts.
- Users install packages at runtime with `brew bundle`, aliased to premade `ujust commands`
- See [custom/brew/README.md](custom/brew/README.md) for details

### Flatpak Support
- Ship your favorite flatpaks
- Automatically installed on first boot after user setup
- See [custom/flatpaks/README.md](custom/flatpaks/README.md) for details

### ujust Commands
- User-friendly command shortcuts via `ujust`
- Pre-configured examples for app installation and system maintenance for you to customize
- See [custom/ujust/README.md](custom/ujust/README.md) for details

### Build Scripts
- Modular numbered scripts (10-, 20-, 30-) run in order
- Example scripts included for third-party repositories and desktop replacement
- Helper functions for safe COPR usage
- See [build/README.md](build/README.md) for details


## Production Checklist

- [X] **Enable Image Signing** (Recommended)
  - Provides cryptographic verification of your images
  - Prevents tampering and ensures authenticity
  - See "Optional: Enable Image Signing" section above for setup instructions
  - Status: **Disabled by default** to allow immediate testing

- [ ] **Enable SBOM Attestation** (Recommended)
  - Generates Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
  - Provides transparency about what's in your image
  - Requires image signing to be enabled first
  - To enable:
    1. First complete image signing setup above
    2. Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
    3. Find the "OPTIONAL: SBOM Attestation" section around line 232
    4. Uncomment the "Add SBOM Attestation" step
    5. Commit and push
  - Status: **Disabled by default** (requires signing first)

- [X] **Enable Image Rechunking** (Recommended)
  - Optimizes bootc image layers for better update performance
  - Reduces update sizes by 5-10x
  - Improves download resumability with evenly sized layers
  - To enable:
    1. Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml`
    2. Find the "Build Image" step
    3. Add a rechunk step after the build (see example below)
  - Status: **Not enabled by default** (optional optimization)

### Adding Image Rechunking

After building your bootc image, add a rechunk step before pushing to the registry. Here's an example based on the workflow used by [zirconium-dev/zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium):

```yaml
- name: Build image
  id: build
  run: sudo podman build -t "${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" -f ./Containerfile .

- name: Rechunk Image
  run: |
    sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
      -v /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers \
      --entrypoint /usr/libexec/bootc-base-imagectl \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      rechunk --max-layers 96 \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"

- name: Push to Registry
  run: sudo podman push "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" "${IMAGE_REGISTRY}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"
```

Alternative approach using a temporary tag for clarity:

```yaml
- name: Rechunk Image
  run: |
    sudo podman run --rm --privileged \
      -v /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers \
      --entrypoint /usr/libexec/bootc-base-imagectl \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      rechunk --max-layers 67 \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}" \
      "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked"
    
    # Tag the rechunked image with the original tag
    sudo podman tag "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked" "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}"
    sudo podman rmi "localhost/${IMAGE_NAME}:${DEFAULT_TAG}-rechunked"
```

**Parameters:**
- `--max-layers`: Maximum number of layers for the rechunked image (typically 67 for optimal balance)
- The first image reference is the source (input)
- The second image reference is the destination (output)
  - When using the same reference for both, the image is rechunked in-place
  - You can also use different tags (e.g., `-rechunked` suffix) and then retag if preferred

- [bootc documentation](https://containers.github.io/bootc/)

### After Enabling Production Features

Your workflow will:
- Sign all images with your key
- Generate and attach SBOMs
- Provide full supply chain transparency

Users can verify your images with:
```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo-name:stable
```
